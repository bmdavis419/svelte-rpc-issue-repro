# Svelte Remote Functions

Svelte recently announced a [proposal for remote functions](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/13897) that's meant to be an alternative to `load` functions in SvelteKit aimed to solve component-level data loading.

This repo includes the code example from [https://github.com/dummdidumm/svelte-async-remote-functions-example](https://github.com/dummdidumm/svelte-async-remote-functions-example), the [Svelte async PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/15844) and [SvelteKit RPC branch](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/rpc-ssr-2) until the PR is out.
